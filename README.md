#The Lancashire wonder, to warn all sinners to repentance Being a full and true account of Mr. Jeremiah Carter, a pious divine of the Church, who was taken with sleepiness on a road going over a high mountain, fell in a deep trance, and lay for the space of four days, from the 8th of December till the 12th, in this present year: he not coming home as expected, how two of his parishioners went to seek him, and found him lying on the mountain. How they brought him home, laid him on the bed, where he lay for the space of six hours. How his spirit came to him, and he hath declared the wonderful things that he has heard in the other world, and what heavy judgements hang over our heads for the crying sins of the day and time, warning all to repent, and cry to God for mercy, or else your sins will speedily find you out. So that here are wonderful things, never publish'd to the world before. Licens'd according to order.#
